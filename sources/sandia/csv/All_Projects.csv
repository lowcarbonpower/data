Kaprun Upper Stage Pumped Storage Power Plant,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"History of the Power Plant  The initial planning for the power plant facilities in the Kaprun Valley date back to the &quot;centralisation project&quot; of the Allgemeine ElektricitÃ¤tsgesellschaft (AEG) Berlin [General Power Company]. The planned pooling of all the water from the Hohe Tauern into the Kaprun Valley was interrupted due to the outbreak of the global economic crisis at the beginning of the 1930&#039;s. With Austria&#039;s annexation to the German Reich in the spring of 1938, the project was once again made a high priority and re-designed under the head of the newly founded Alpen Elektrowerke AG (AEW [Alpine Power Company]), Hermann Grengg. The new plans contemplated a two stage pumped storage power plant with an upper storage reservoir on the Mooserboden and Wasserfallboden storage lakes above the Limberg Alp. The construction work began with the construction of new and expansion of existing access roads to the construction sites, in particular to the Kapruner Winkel [Kaprun Corner], the building site of the Hauptstufe [main stage] power house, and to the Limberg Alp. When the war ended, the Hauptstufe power house and a makeshift dam on the Wasserfallboden were ready for operation.  Construction of the Oberstufe [upper stage] power house could not begin, however until completion of the Limberg dam, which was to connect airside to the new structure. In the final phase of the work on the barrier, more and more attention was given to the archtectonic design of the Limberg power house. To this end, an invitation to tender was held to design of the crown of dam and powerhouse with architect Harald Bauer&#039;s design being selected. For the power house however, the third-placed architect Edith Lassmann&#039;s design was selected.  The contract was awarded at the beginning of 1951 and the excavation work for the power house to be attached to the nearly completed dam began immediately thereafter. Between May and August 1951 alone, around 10,000 mÂ³ of rock was removed from the area of the foundations for the new power house. The construction materials were transported via a tow-railway from the Bruck/Fusch station to the Kapruner Winkel and from there taken to the Limberg site with a cement cable railway.  In 1953 the construction work on the main structure was completed. Construction on the stilling basin continued until June 1954 since the final form was not set until after extensive studies and model tests had been carried out by the planning department of Tauernkraftwerke AG.  The first machine set was commissioned on 14 November 1954, the second on1 December 1955. Both of the MÃ¶ll connecting bridge pumps in the pump cave next to the Drossensperre retaining wall followed on 28 May 1956.

Electrical generators are turned by water flowing from a reservoir on top of Proffit Mountain into a lower reservoir on the East Fork of the Black River. The generators and turbines at river level are reversible, and at night the excess electricity available on the power grid is used to pump water back to the mountaintop.  The Taum Sauk plant is notable in that it is a pure pump-back operation â€“ there is no natural primary flow available for generation, unlike most other pumped storage sites. It was among the largest such projects when it was built. Construction of the Taum Sauk plant began in 1960 and operation began in 1963.

Pumped storage hydroelectric power plants, which pump in water during low-demand evening hours and use it to generate power during peak hours, have become the mainstream of hydroelectric power generation in recent years in Japan.  http://www.jepic.or.jp/en/data/EPIJJapanData.pdf  http://www.industcards.com/ps-japan.htm",260000,0,36.154152,137.75,,"Electric Energy Time Shift, Electric Supply Capacity, ",3081-226 Azumi,Matsumoto,Nagano,,Japan,http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/useful/pdf-3/12i_full-e.pdf,,01-01-1970,,,,,Investor Owned,,,Utility-Owned,Tokyo Electric Power Company,0,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,0,0,,,0,,,0,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,

It created the Allegheny Reservoir, a lake that stretches 25 miles (40 km) upriver.  The power plant, rated at 435 MW, was built by the Pennsylvania Electric Company and Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company. It began commercial operation in 1970. Through business mergers and acquisitions, the plant is now owned by FirstEnergy, an operator of several base load (nuclear and coal-fired) power plants. Pumped storage plants function similarly to a storage battery; they absorb excess power generated by such plants in off-peak hours, such as nighttime, using it to pump water into a reservoir.

Tumut Hydroelectric Power Station 3,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"Tumut 3 Power Station is the first pumped storage hydroelectric power station in Australia. Pump-storage schemes use off-peak energy to pump water to a reservoir on a higher level. This water then passes through turbines to generate electricity when prices are higher. The sole powerhouse is located above ground, approximately 1,800 metres (5,900 ft) below Talbingo Dam.   The power station is fitted with six Toshiba turbines, three of which are reversible pump-turbines. All six turbines are equipped with Melco-manufactured generators, and they have a combined generating capacity of 1,500 megawatts (2,000,000 hp) of electricity.   The power station was completed in 1973, and has 150.9 metres (495 ft) rated head. Water is pumped through six pipelines, each 488 metres (1,601 ft) long and 5.6 metres (18 ft) in diameter, delivering water to Talbingo Reservoir.   During 2003, Snowy Hydro commissioned six 140 kilowatts (190 hp) micro-hydro generators on the existing cooling water systems on each of the six generating units at Tumut 3 Power Station. These GreenPower accredited units enable Snowy Hydro to save approximately 3,137 tonnes (3,458 short tons) of carbon dioxide per annum. In addition, this installation not only captures previous wasted renewable energy, but also will be substantially reducing the noise that was associated with the previous pressure reducing valves on the six generating unit&#039;s cooling systems.

Ludington Pumped Storage,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"The Ludington Pumped Storage Plant sits on a 1,000-acre site along the Lake Michigan shoreline. The plant was built between 1969-73 and is jointly owned by Consumers Energy and Detroit Edison, and operated by Consumers Energy. The plant contributes directly to local governments about $11 million in annual property taxes.  Revenue from plant operations, maintenance and overhauls also contribute significant sums to the local economy.  Local residents still refer to the plant as â€œThe Projectâ€.  One of the worldâ€™s biggest electric â€œbatteriesâ€, Ludington can provide energy at a momentâ€™s notice. Its ability lies in its 27-billion gallon reservoir and a set of six turbines that drive electric generators.  Those same turbines double as giant water pumps to fill the reservoir with water from Lake Michigan. At night, when electric demand is low, Ludingtonâ€™s reversible turbines pump water 363 feet uphill from Lake Michigan. The water is pumped through six large pipes, or â€œpenstocksâ€, to the 842-acre reservoir. During the day, when electric demand is high, the reservoir releases water to flow downhill through the penstocks. The flowing water turns turbines and generators in the powerhouse to make electricity. The plant can generate up to 1,872 megawatts â€” enough electricity to serve a community of 1.4 million residential customers. The output is more than double the capacity of any single unit on Consumers Energyâ€™s system. Ludingtonâ€™s relatively simple technology enables the plant to respond quickly to the daily, weekly and seasonal highs and lows of Michiganâ€™s energy demand. The plant also saves customers money by enabling Consumers Energy to avoid the expensive spot market when customer demand exceeds the capacity of the companyâ€™s baseload plants.  The immense size of Ludington and its six-unit design offers flexibility in balancing customer demand with electric output on a momentâ€™s notice.

This water is used to irrigate approximately 670,000 acres of farmland in the Columbia Basin Project. More than 60 crops are grown in the basin and distributed across the nation  Construction of the irrigation facilities began in 1948. Components of the project include the pump-generating plant, feeder canal, and equalizing reservoir, which was later named Banks Lake. Banks Lake was formed by damming the northern 27 miles of the Grand Coulee, and has an active storage capacity of 715,000 acre-feet. The lake stores water for irrigation and also provides important recreational benefits to the region. The pump-generating plant began operation in 1951. From 1951 to 1953, six pumping units, each rated at 65,000 horsepower and with a capacity to pump 1,600 cubic feet per second, were installed in the plant.   In the early 1960s, investigations revealed the potential for power generation. Reversible pumps were installed to allow water from Banks Lake to flow back through the units to generate power during periods of peak demand. The first three generating pumps came online in 1973. Two more generating pumps were installed in 1983; the final generating pump was installed in January 1984. The total generating capacity of the plant is now 314,000 kilowatts.

Plans of the Ã–sterreichische Bundesbahnen followed after 1945. In 1952, Ã–sterreichische Draukraftwerke AG (Ã–DK) carried out water and energy-related tests and created a plan for the utilisation of the Malta and GÃ¶ÃŸbÃ¤che with a three-stage power plant group. A dissertation written in 1956 at the technical university in Graz by Erich Magnet with the title &quot;Winter Storage Plant Inner Maltatal-Kolbnitz&quot; was used by Ã–sterreichische Draukraftwerke AG and proved to be very important for the development of the project.  The water rights negotiations for the Malta upper stage and Malta main stage power plants took place in 1964. The approval of the water authorities was granted in 1965. Heavy protests, especially from the Austrian Society for Nature Conservation, followed when the project area lost its nature conservation status. The conservationists called for the erection of nuclear power stations as an alternative to storage power plants. The detailed planning commenced in 1971 following the positive construction decision.  In addition to covering demand peaks, it was required that the power plant group Malta must, at all times, be in a position to provide reserve power for a failed nuclear power plant. The earlier-than-expected issuing of the building decision and the new requirements created major challenges for the planning and construction departments. In addition, the first machine unit for the main stage was to be commissioned two years earlier than expected on 1 December 1978. The planning was carried out, inter alia, by Construction Director Kurt BaustÃ¤dter, Rudolf MuÃŸnig, Kurt Landl, Heiner Ludescher and Georg Lichtenegger from Draukraftwerke AG. External planners, such as the civil technology company EhÃŸ, were also engaged. The architectural work was carried out by Rudolf Nitsch from Klagenfurt.  After a series of geological tests, the final location for Rottau power plant was fixed in 1973. The excavation pit reached a depth of approximately 30 metres below the valley basin and 25 metres below the groundwater level. Extensive safety measures were necessary to prevent the penetration of groundwater. The first machine unit was commissioned in Rottau power plant in late autumn 1976. The storage pumps were commissioned in summer 1978.

Malta Upper Stage Pumped Storage Power Plant,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"History of the Power Plant  The first plans for the energy-technical utilisation of the waters at the upper end of the Malta Valley, which is known for its extremely high precipitation levels, date back to the 1930s. The decision by Ã–sterreichische Draukraftwerke AG (Ã–DK) to construct the three-stage Malta power plant, however, did not follow until 1957. The power plants comprise an upper stage with KÃ¶lnbrein reservoir and Galgenbichl power house, the main stage with Galgenbichl reservoir in the upper Malta valley between Gamskarnock and Lausnock, the main stage power house in Rottau near Kolbnitz in the MÃ¶ll valley as well as the lower stage with a diversion channel in the MÃ¶ll valley and MÃ¶llbrÃ¼cke power house in the Drau valley.  Given that it had only been established for a short time, Ã–DK did not, however, have the financial resources necessary to construct the ReiÃŸeck, Kreuzeck and Malta power plants at the same time. For this reason, detailed planning did not commence until 1961 following the completion of the ReiÃŸeck-Kreuzeck power plants. In 1965, the Malta-Upper Stage and Malta-Main Stage projects were approved by the water authorities.  The construction work for Galgenbichl power house followed after commencement of work on the KÃ¶lnbrein Dam and the Galgenbichl reservoir. The construction warehouse was extended in April 1974 and work on the development of the construction site commenced. Machinery and equipment from the neighbouring construction site at Galgenbichl Dam were used during the construction period.  The excavation work commenced in the east section of the power house, and due to the tight time schedule, continued through winter 1974/75. The work to stabilise the 40-metre cliff to the west of the power house to which parts of the building are attached proved to be a major challenge. An external firm was commissioned to supply and prepare 800 tons of twisted ribbed steel so as to save time by working parallel. In spite of weather-related delays, work on the assembly of the first machine commenced on 1 September 1975 and the assembly of the second machine followed in 1976.  The power house was handed over to Ã–DK on 1 September 1976.

It is a construction with daily water accumulation that participates in the functioning of the frequency regulation and of the distribution of electricity to the grid. This hydraulic structure consists of four parts: an upper and a lower reservoir, penstocks and a power station. The lower reservoir was created by means of damming up the valley of the ÄŒierny VÃ¡h by a 375 m long dam. Its capacity is 5.1 million m3. The level fluctuates by 7.45 m between elevations 726.00 â€“ 733.45 m. The upper reservoir of an irregular shape is situated between the valleys of the Biely VÃ¡h and the ÄŒierny VÃ¡h. It has a maximum capacity of 3.7 million m3 of water and the level fluctuates by 25 m between the elevation points 1160 â€“ 1135 m above sea level. The sealing of the slopes and of the bottom is provided by one layer of asphalt concrete sealing blanket with a surface of approximately 200,000 m2. Underneath the reservoir, there is an inspection tunnel that should collect the potential seepages from the reservoir bottom and slopes. The hydraulic connection of the upper and lower reservoir is ensured via three pressure penstocks which have an internal diameter of 3.8 m. In the valley, they split into pipes that transport the water to the two turbines and outlets of water from the two accumulation pumps. The maximum head between the upper and the lower reservoirs is 434 m. The lower reservoir dam includes also a power station with a control room. There are six pumping turbo aggregates installed that comprise a motor generator, a Francis turbine and an accumulation pump. When 6 accumulation pumps are in operation, it takes 8 hours to pump the water into the upper reservoir.

However, during periods when the demand for electricity is low (such as evenings, weekends, or during seasonal fluctuations), the dam can use its excess power generating capacity to pump water back into the reservoirâ€”enhancing reservoir capacity and storing water for periods when the demand for electricity is high. At the time it was constructed, the AldeadÃ¡vila Dam had the largest pumping station in Europe.   The AldeadÃ¡vila Dam has two diversion tunnels, each 1,400 metres (4,600 ft) in length. Each tunnel has a 53-metre (174 ft) high surge tank. The dam also contains more than 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) of tunnels which divert water to the electrical generation turbines. There are six penstock tunnels, each about 5 metres (16 ft) in diameter. The design of the penstocks and auxiliary spillways using these tunnels has proved to be an issue, however.

McIntosh CAES Plant - Unit 1 Facility Stores Compressed Air in a Solution-mined Salt Cavern,Electro-mechanical,Compressed Air Energy Storage,Compressed Air Energy Storage,Operational,"&lt;p&gt;The 2nd commercial CAES plant, in operation since 1991. Like the Huntorf plant, the McIntosh Unit 1 facility stores compressed air in a solution-mined salt cavern. The cavern is 220 ft in diameter and 1,000 ft tall, for a total volume of 10 million cubic feet. At full charge, the cavern is pressurized to 1,100 psi, and it is discharged down to 650 psi. During discharge, 340 pounds of air flow out of the cavern each second. The cavern can discharge for 26 hours. The plant also utilizes nuclear-sourced night-time power for compression and then produces peak power during the day by releasing the compressed air into a 110-MW gas-fired combustion turbine built by Dresser Rand. The turbine unit also makes use of an air-to-air heat exchanger to preheat air from the cavern with waste heat from the turbine. The waste heat recovery system reduces fuel usage by roughly 25%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to conventional combustion turbines, the CAES-fed system can start up in 15 minutes rather than 30 minutes, uses only 30% to 40% of the natural gas, and operates efficiently down to low loads (about 25% of full load).

JC Penney Headquarters - Calmac,Thermal Storage,Ice Thermal Storage,Ice Thermal Storage,Operational,"CALMACâ€™s technology has proven its versatility to reduce operating costs since the tanks were installed in 1991. However, today the energy landscape in Texas is vastly different from 25 years ago. JCPenney is currently faced with a ratcheted demand charge from its utility as well as coincident peak charge, which make up a large portion of the companyâ€™s monthly utility bill.  With the ratcheted demand pricing, the month with the highest energy usage sets the annual peak demand charge. In 2013, the annual peak demand charge was set in August at $37,479. The charge is ratcheted at 80 percent, which means that for the 11 months following August, JCPenney pays a demand charge of $29,983 (80 percent of $37,479). This applies unless a new peak demand is set, in which case the process starts over.   The other significant demand charge that JCPenneyâ€™s Headquarters incurs is called a Transmission Cost Recovery Factor, also known as a 4CP or coincident peak demand charge.

Bad Creek Pumped Hydro Storage,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"The Bad Creek Hydroelectric Station is a 1,065-megawatt pumped-storage facility located in Oconee County, eight miles north of Salem, S.C. The four-unit station began generating electricity in 1991, and is the largest hydroelectric station on the Duke Energy system. It is named for the two streams, Bad Creek and West Bad Creek, which were dammed to create the Bad Creek reservoir.  The Bad Creek facility utilizes two reservoirs (or lakes) to generate electricity: an upper reservoir and a lower reservoir. Water stored in an upper lake is released into underground power tunnels. The water rushes down the tunnels, driving huge turbines, which are underground at the base of a dam. The spinning turbines are connected to large generators, which produce the electricity. The water then flows through draft tubes into a lower lake.  A pumped-storage hydroelectric station uses the same water over and over again, making more efficient use of water resources. When demand for electricity is low, operators can refill the lake, as if they were â€œrechargingâ€ a battery. Using power from other generating stations, the generators act as electric motors spinning the huge turbines backward. This pumps water back up the power tunnels into the upper lake. Water is generally pumped back to the upper reservoir at night and on weekends.  With the reservoir at full-pond elevation and generating with all four units, Bad Creek can generate for 24 hours within its maximum 160â€™ drawdown.

New Waddell Dam&#039;s primary purpose is to store Colorado River water for CAP use. The dam also stores Agua Fria River runoff and provides flood protection by controlling river flows. The dam is located one-half mile downstream of historic Waddell Dam, which was built by the Maricopa Water District (MWD). The dam&#039;s reservoir, Lake Pleasant, also stores water for MWD irrigation.  In the winter, Colorado River water is pumped uphill from the CAP aqueduct into Lake Pleasant when power rates are low. In the summer, when demand for water and electricity increases, water is released through the Pump-Generating plant, producing hydroelectric power that is sold to help repay the CAP&#039;s construction costs. In addition, New Waddell Dam adds 7,000 surface acres to the lake, greatly increasing the recreational value of Lake Pleasant Regional Park.  Handicapped-accessible recreational facilities include 3 multiple-lane boat ramps, 450 picnic sites, 225 campsites, 14 group use areas, 4 overlooks, a full-service marina equipped to handle 1000 boats, and 7 miles of trail. Because the reservoir water level may fluctuate up to 125 feet during a typical year&#039;s operation, the facilities will be located to be accessible during both high and low water periods.  If necessary, floodwaters can be released from the dam through the river outlet works tunnel into the Agua Fria River immediately below the dam. If the reservoir&#039;s flood storage capacity is ever exceeded, water can also be released over spillways located west of the dam. This water would flow down Morgan City Wash and back to the Agua Fria River about one mile below the dam.  The cost of constructing New Waddell Dam was more than $625 million.

Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) Battery System,Electro-chemical,Lead-acid Battery,Lead-acid Battery,De-Commissioned,"The PREPA was a fully commercial battery system that was acquired for daily operation in a frequency control and spinning reserve mode for the island grid of Puerto Rico. The grid had ongoing stability issues, and routinely had frequency and voltage excursions that could only be controlled by aggressive load-shedding, unless new generation was added to provide regulation and stability. The choices for new generation included fast-acting combustion turbines or battery energy storage. PREPA&#039;s analysis showed that battery energy storage systems offered superior operational benefits due to their faster reaction times, both for frequency regulation and spinning reserve requirements.  The comparable slower response times of combustion turbines required more installed capacity, whereas the faster reaction time of a battery system meant that a much smaller battery could offer the same functionality as larger sizes of combustion turbines. Typically, battery systems can reach full operating power in less than 1 second, whereas mechanical systems such as combustion turbines need several seconds to minutes to reach their full power output. The seemingly small difference in reaction times translates into very large consequences for the stability of the electric grid, where events that lead to outages propagate within cycles, and a difference of 1 min translates to a complete blackout under some conditions. Thus, it was shown that battery systems were a more cost effective option compared to combustion turbines because a smaller battery could outperform a much larger block of combustion turbines. This is particularly applicable to an &quot;island&quot; system, where there is no interconnection with a neighboring system to balance the momentary shortage of generation resources during an operational contingency.  The PREPA battery was patterned after the BEWAG battery in application as well as battery type. Valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) batteries were commercially available by the time the PREPA battery project was started, but PREPA chose a flooded, flat-plate cell because it had a proven track record at BEWAG. However, once utility operations began in 1994, the battery was cycled more frequently than planned, which caused the battery to age more rapidly than expected. This use led to positive-plate growth, which caused cell / jar cracks, leaks, short circuits, and ultimately early battery failure.  PREPA made the decision in 2001 to repower, or replace, the battery. A tubular positive plate, flooded battery was selected, and the new battery was installed in mid-2004.

PacifiCorp Castle Valley VRB,Electro-chemical,Flow Battery,Vanadium Redox Flow Battery,De-Commissioned,"PacifiCorp is a utility based in Portland, Oregon with operations in six Western states. The Castle Valley site was serviced by a 25 kV feeder over 85 miles long, with 209 miles of total line. The length of the feeder led to complaints of low reliability and power quality. In addition, the feeder could not supply any significant amount of new load without causing low voltage to existing customers. Traditional alternatives to add capacity and improve service in this area are costly and environmentally difficult, so that PacifiCorp has sought viable alternatives to meet these goals. The Castle Valley VRB System was built and commissioned for this purpose.  Vanadium redox flow batteries store energy in two electrolytes which are pumped from separate storage tanks across proton exchange membranes in the cell stacks, producing a DC current. The reaction is reversible, so that the battery can be charged and discharged repeatedly with high efficiency. The VRB-ESSâ„¢ at Castle Valley was built by VRB Power Systems of Vancouver, British Columbia. The system was sized to provide 250 kW for 8 hours, with a round-trip efficiency when fully operational of between 65% and 80%.

Tomamae Wind Farm ,Electro-chemical,Flow Battery,Vanadium Redox Flow Battery,Operational,"The Tomamae Wind Villa Power Plant continues to be one of the worldâ€™s largest vanadium redox flow battery energy storage installations and, at the time of commissioning in 2000, was Japanâ€™s first and largest wind power plant. In 2005, Sumitomo Electric International (Osaka, Japan) was contracted to install a vanadium flow battery system at the existing 30.6 MW Tomamae Wind Villa on the island of Hokkaido, Japan. The primary intent of the battery system is to provide â€œwind smoothingâ€ for the intermittent and variable wind plant.  The facility has operated well since 5 January 2005, sometimes performing over 50 charge-discharge cycles per hour. By acting as a rapid source and sink for the sometimes highly variable wind energy production, this facility has reduced the ramping rates of the wind farmâ€™s output with respect to the rest of the islandâ€™s grid by reducing the peaks and valleys of the wind farm energy output.   The project is located on a Tomamae Town managed stock farm.  Scenery and farm land utilization is preserved by burying the power cables and installing transformers in the turbine towers. The energy storage facility is configured with 16 modules rated at 250 kW each, which gives the entire facility 4 MW with 6 MWh of storage (90 minutes).  Pulse power of 6 MW exists, but only for 20 minutes.  The project was developed and is owned by J-Power, the largest electric utility in Japan. While moving into wind generation, J-Power produces most of itâ€™s electricity from coal-fired and hydroelectric power plants.

Virtua Health Data Center Calnetix (formerly VYCON) Flywheel,Electro-mechanical,Flywheel,Flywheel,Operational,"&lt;p&gt;VYCON, Inc. has successfully commissioned a beta unit in the United States. Virtua Health, located in New Jersey, has partnered with VYCON to install a VDC140 Flywheel Energy Storage System at the Virtua Health data center. This installation is one of high visibility for both companies as it is in a critical application. Performance of the system is monitored remotely from VYCONâ€™s offices in California. The system was installed and has been in operation since mid-December. The modern power system at Virtua Healthâ€™s Gibbsboro facility utilizes Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) that protect their servers from utility power disturbances. Automatic Transfer Switches (ATS), that detect loss of utility power, command the Generator sets on site to automatically start during power outages. The VDC140 is in operation with a UPS to provide ride-through power while the generator starts during a power loss or disturbance, keeping the servers on-line. The VDC140 at Virtua Health operates in parallel with Lead Acid Batteries. In this application, the VDC140 is the first line of defense, designed to be discharged before the batteries, therefore providing power to the UPS during most power disturbances. The battery DC source is discharged only if the generator does not start and in effect reduces the cycles the batteries are subjected to, extending battery life. Initial tests and actual power outages at the site have shown that during transfers to generator, the VDC140 has performed as expected providing ride-through power&lt;/p&gt;",140,0,39.8381698,-74.9648887,,"Electric Supply Reserve Capacity - Spinning, Resiliency, ",,Gibbsboro,New Jersey,,United States ,https://www.calnetix.com/newsroom/press-release/vycon%E2%80%99s-bearing-less-flywheel-energy-storage-system-spins-better-healthcare,03-01-2006,03-01-2006,,,PJM,,Investor Owned,Transmission,,Customer-Owned,Virtua Health,100,,,Calnetix (formerly VYCON),,,,,,,,,0,,0,0,,,0,,,0,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,

Coral Bay PowerStore Flywheel Project - PowerStore Grid-Stabilizing System,Electro-mechanical,Flywheel,Flywheel,Operational,"&lt;p&gt;Coral Bay is the gateway to the Ningaloo Reef World Heritage Area in Northwestern Australia, where power demand increases significantly during the tourist season. A PowerStore grid-stabilizing system and DCS power management solution oversees the townâ€™s power supply, which consists of seven 320 kilowatt (kW) low-load diesel generation units combined with three 200 kW wind turbines. PowerStoreâ€™s 500 kW flywheel technology enables the wind turbines to supply up to 95 percent of Coral Bayâ€™s energy supply at times, with a total annual wind penetration of 45 percent, while maintaining city grid standards of power stability and quality. Power station data indicates more than 80 percent of Coral Bayâ€™s power is wind generated for one-third of the year. The data also shows that for nearly 900 hours per year, wind provides more than 90 percent of Coral Bayâ€™s power supply. PowerStore maximizes an environmentally friendly solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PowerStore is a compact and versatile flywheel-based grid stabilizing generator. Its main purpose is to stabilize power systems against fluctuations in frequency and voltage. It includes state-of-the-art inverters and virtual generator control software. It enables the integration of intermittent and often erratic renewable generation and the higher utilization of renewable energy generators, protecting remote communities from exposure to volatile oil prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PowerStore safeguards conventional microgrids, and ensures the safe integration of large amounts of wind and solar energy, reducing emissions and dependency on fossil fuels. High-speed software controls the power flow into and out of the flywheel, essentially making it a high inertia electrical shock absorber that can instantly smooth out power fluctuations generated by wind turbines or solar arrays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PowerStore acts like a STATCOM (advanced grid technology that quickly stabilizes voltage and improves power quality) and in addition is capable of rapidly absorbing or injecting real power within an isolated power network. It can stabilize both voltage and frequency, hold 18 MWs (megawatt seconds) of energy and shift from full absorption to full injection in 1 millisecond to stabilize the grid.&lt;/p&gt;",500,0,-23.1410266,113.7764051,,"Frequency Regulation, Voltage Support, ",,Coral Bay,Western Australia,,Australia,http://new.abb.com/power-generation/references/providing-coral-bay-with-high-quality-power,,01-01-2007,01-01-2007,,,,Investor Owned,Transmission,Wind / Diesel,Customer-Owned,Verve Energy,100,,,ABB,ABB,,,,,,,,0,,0,0,,,0,,,0,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,,

Rokkasho Village Wind Farm - Futamata Wind Development,Electro-chemical,Sodium based Battery,Sodium-sulfur Battery,Operational,"In May 2008, JWD completed construction of a wind farm near Rokkasho village in Aomori Prefecture, in northern Honshu. This smart grid wind farm is the first facility of its type to use sodium sulfur (NAS) batteries to store electricity for supply to the national power grid. These batteries are charged at night, when the demand for power is lower, and the stored electricity can be supplied to the grid together with the electricity generated by the windmills during the daylight hours. This ensures a steady supply of power to the grid even during those periods when power production falls as the result of low wind speed.

AEP Bluffton NaS Energy Storage System,Electro-chemical,Sodium based Battery,Sodium-sulfur Battery,Operational,"AEP has pioneered the use of NaS batteries in the United States. Following testing at its Dolan Technology Center near Columbus, OH, the utility became the first U.S. electric company to deploy NaS batteries in 2002 when it installed and operated a 100kW/500kVA demonstration unit in Gahanna, OH. In 2006, AEP installed a 1.2-MW stationary NaS battery near Charleston, WV. And in 2008, the utility installed three, 2-MW NaS batteries: one in Churubusco, IN.; one in Milton, WV; and one in Bluffton, OH. The 7.2 MW in NaS deployments are part of AEPâ€™s electricity storage strategy that will also include transportable stationary batteries and distributed small scale energy storage systems.  AEP deployed all of its NaS installations as a means to provide load leveling and alleviate transformer loading during summer peaks, defer capital upgrades, and offer emergency backup power to several hundred customers during electrical system outages. Ultimately, the NaS units offer AEP a degree of flexibility in determining the optimal approach for handling reliability problems. The units buy the utility time to decide whether to redesign a substation, build generation, or keep the storage units in place permanently. (All of the NaS systems are capable of being relocated for an estimated $85,000 to $115,000 if and when the companyâ€™s needs for storage change.)  AEPâ€™s 2-MW units were deployed in 2008, and are capable of providing islanding (backup power) for over seven hours when loss of utility power from the substation occurs. These newer installations can also perform load-triggered load leveling which, for example, allows the batteries to discharge just enough energy to hold a constrained substation transformer constant. As a result, a greater amount of energy can be reserved for islanding and battery life can be extended due to less frequent discharging.  AEP uses an in-house SCADA system and developed custom software to control all of its batteries based on the loading transformer. The software essentially creates a feedback loop where the load of the transformer is compared to a desired maximum, and the battery output is then adjusted to achieve that maximum.

In addition, the unit sited at the Balls Gap substation in Milton, WV successfully islanded approximately 700 customers for roughly 30 minutes during a simulated outage staged on July 8, 2009. A live islanding event, meanwhile, took place in December 2009, during a snowstorm that islanded 25 customers for two days. Over that period, the Milton installation was able to minimize disruptions; customers experienced less than three minutes of continuous disruption during the two-day outage period.  Finally, on October 20, 2009, the Milton, WV battery was successfully operated to alleviate load and voltage concerns during a load transfer event between substations. While the transformer at one station was taken out of service for maintenance, load was transferred to a different station which caused voltage and loading concerns. The Milton battery was deployed and mitigated these concerns.

Antarctica NZ ABB PowerStore Flywheel - Meridian Energy (stabilize both voltage and frequency),Electro-mechanical,Flywheel,Flywheel,Operational,"&lt;p&gt;New Zealandâ€™s Scott Base and Americaâ€™s McMurdo Station in Antarctica are important research bases and home to about 1,200 people in the Antarctic summer. They have always relied completely on fossil fuels for power and heating, until a new system based on wind turbines, a new distributed control system and PowerStore grid-stabilizing technology was commissioned in 2009. The bases still need back-up diesel generators, but three 333 kilowatt (kW) wind turbines reduce the amount of diesel required for power generation by around 463,000 liters, and cut CO2 emissions by 1,242 metric tons per year, while lowering the risks of transporting and storing liquid fuel in this precious environment. A frequency converter interconnects the Scott and McMurdo bases, which operate at different frequencies - 50 Hz (NZ) and 60 Hz (US), allowing power flow in both directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PowerStore is a compact and versatile flywheel-based grid stabilizing generator. Its main purpose is to stabilize power systems against fluctuations in frequency and voltage. It includes state-of-the-art inverters and virtual generator control software. It enables the integration of intermittent and often erratic renewable generation and the higher utilization of renewable energy generators, protecting remote communities from exposure to volatile oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PowerStore safeguards conventional microgrids, and ensures the safe integration of large amounts of wind and solar energy, reducing emissions and dependency on fossil fuels. High-speed software controls the power flow into and out of the flywheel, essentially making it a high inertia electrical shock absorber that can instantly smooth out power fluctuations generated by wind turbines or solar arrays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PowerStore acts like a STATCOM (advanced grid technology that quickly stabilizes voltage and improves power quality) and in addition is capable of rapidly absorbing or injecting real power within an isolated power network.

"Marble Bar PowerStore Flywheel Project - 2,000 Solar Modules and a Solar Tracking System",Electro-mechanical,Flywheel,Flywheel,Operational,"&lt;p&gt;The worldâ€™s first high penetration, solar photovoltaic diesel power stations were commissioned in 2010 in the towns of Nullagine and Marble Bar, in Western Australia. The projects include more than 2,000 solar modules and a solar tracking system that follows the path of the sun throughout the day. When the sun is shining, PowerStore grid-stabilizing technology and DCS power management solution ensures maximum solar energy (100% peak penetration) goes into the network by lowering diesel generation, up to the minimum loading of the generation units. When the sun is obscured, the PowerStore covers the loss of solar power generation as the DCS ramps up the diesel generation, so the network has an uninterrupted energy supply. The solar energy systems generate over 1 gigawatt hour (GWh) of renewable energy per year, supplying 60 percent of the average daytime energy for both towns, saving 405,000 liters of fuel and 1,100 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions each year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PowerStore is a compact and versatile flywheel-based grid stabilizing generator. Its main purpose is to stabilize power systems against fluctuations in frequency and voltage. It includes state-of-the-art inverters and virtual generator control software. It enables the integration of intermittent and often erratic renewable generation and the higher utilization of renewable energy generators, protecting remote communities from exposure to volatile oil prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PowerStore safeguards conventional microgrids, and ensures the safe integration of large amounts of wind and solar energy, reducing emissions and dependency on fossil fuels. High-speed software controls the power flow into and out of the flywheel, essentially making it a high inertia electrical shock absorber that can instantly smooth out power fluctuations generated by wind turbines or solar arrays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PowerStore acts like a STATCOM (advanced grid technology that quickly stabilizes voltage and improves power quality) and in addition is capable of rapidly absorbing or injecting real power within an isolated power network. It can stabilize both voltage and frequency, hold 18 MWs (megawatt seconds) of energy and shift from full absorption to full injection in 1 millisecond to stabilize the grid.&lt;/p&gt;",500,0,-21.16493,119.741631,,"Frequency Regulation, Voltage Support, ",,Marble Bar,Western Australia,,Australia,http://www.abb.com/cawp/seitp202/38567a1472ea578fc1257e8a0030a70d.aspx,,01-01-2010,01-01-2010,,,Horizon Power,State/Municipal Owned,Transmission,Solar / Diesel,Utility-Owned,Horizon Power,100,,,ABB,ABB,,,,,,,,0,,0,0,,,0,,,0,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,,

Magellan GPSS - SWR ,Electro-chemical,Lithium-ion Battery,Lithium Iron Phosphate Battery,Operational,"This Grid Power Support System (GPSS) energy storage system was designed specifically for the SWER (Single Wire Earth Return) power transmission system. The SWER power lines are used throughout the world, with the network here in Australia being one of the largest, covering 200,000 km and servicing approximately 100,000 rural customers. The SWER power lines were first utilised after WWII because they offered a simple, low cost power solution by supplying power through a single wire and circulating it back via the earth.  Currently however, the SWER power line network suffers from poor voltage regulation, poor power factor and overload capability.  The GPSS-SWR consists of a single phase rugged IGBT bi-directional inverter, and 100 kWh of Lithium Iron Phosphate batteries. The primary function of GPSS-SWR is voltage regulation, power factor correction, peak current injection (to clear the downstream fuse) and to provide UPS function.

Rankin Substation Energy Storage Project,Electro-chemical,Sodium based Battery,Sodium-nickel-chloride Battery,De-Commissioned,"***This project was De-Commissioned in December 2014 and was replaced by a new Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) with more details under these two entries: - Duke Energy Rankin Substation - Win Inertia / Maxwell - Duke Energy Rankin Substation - Win Inertia / Aquion Energy  In 2010, Duke Energy, FIAMM, and S&amp;amp;C Electric Company came together to solve a problem that Duke Energy was beginning to experience on distribution circuits that have a high penetration of distributed solar generation. Due to passing clouds, solar energy output was observed to rapidly fluctuate; cases were observed where over 80% of a solar unit&#039;s output would drop in less than five seconds.  This rapid fluctuation in circuit power flows can cause undesirable voltage conditions that are significant for existing infrastructure to correct. To solve this, a battery system was envisioned that charged and discharged to absorb the solar-induced &quot;power swings&quot;, allowing the circuit&#039;s voltage profile to remain smooth despite significant and rapid changes to the power flows along it.   Duke has arranged 12 batteries manufactured by the Italian company FIAMM for use in series in hybrid electric buses to make a 402-kilowatt battery. It is used to smooth out large minute-by-minute spikes and troughs in production from the 1.2-megawatt rooftop solar project Duke operates about a mile away.  The Rankin project is designed to give Duke hard data on what would be the smallest battery that could be used to reduce these swings effectively.  FIAMM donated the battery to Duke to participate in getting the information. Dan Sowder, Senior Project Manager in Duke&#039;s Emerging-Technology Office says the Italian company is designing products for use with solar projects, based on the information it gets from the Rankin project.",402,0.7,35.2981943,-81.02,,"Frequency Regulation, Renewables Capacity Firming, Voltage Support, ",Rankin Avenue Retail Substation,Mount Holly,North Carolina,28120,United States,http://www.duke-energy.com/news/releases/2013020701.asp,,01-12-2011,,01-12-2014,,Duke Energy,Investor Owned,Primary Distribution,1.2 MW Solar PV,Utility-Owned,Duke Energy,100,,,FIAMM Energy Storage Solutions,,S&amp;C Electric Company,,,,,,,0,,0,0,,,0,,,0,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,,

The InterContinental San Francisco has already benefited from traditional energy conservation and efficiency measures. Additional measures would have been difficult without compromising the comfort of hotel guests.  Harry Hobbs, IHG&#039;s Western Area Director of Engineering, was looking for a way to tackle high demand charges due to load spikes, which are not addressed through standard energy efficiency measures.   After hearing about the Stem system, Harry decided to deploy systems in both San Francisco InterContinental hotels.  Harry was able to take advantage of the California Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) to cover 60% of the system installation cost.  Stem&#039;s solution was installed in November 2012 and immediately began leveraging the proprietary combination of big data, predictive analytics, and energy storage to effectively &quot;hybridize&quot; the hotels by intelligently switching between battery power and grid power to reduce energy costs.    Independent verification of results was conducted by corporate staff using a third party revenue-grade meter and simulated load.

Pennsylvania ATLAS (Aggregated Transactive Load Asset),Thermal Storage,Heat Thermal Storage,Heat Thermal Storage,Operational,"VCharge, recognizing the energy storage potential of ETS, developed electronic controls for these heating systems that allow individual heaters or electric boilers to be switched on or off rapidly (within seconds) of the receipt of a control signal by VChargeâ€™s Network Operations Center from the areaâ€™s grid operator, PJM Interconnect. The innovation started in the tidy development of Stones Throw in East Stroudsburg, where developers had installed identical ETS units in the 1980â€²s and â€™90s, making it a perfect place to pilot VChargeâ€™s technology. Now, over 40 Stones Throw homeowners, and nearly another 100 in the surrounding area, have installed free controls on their ETS heaters to participate in this radical experiment in grid storage and energy managementâ€“and to get a 25% discount on their home heating bills.  By itself, any individual heating system is relatively unremarkable.

Orkney Storage Park Project,Electro-chemical,Lithium-ion Battery,Lithium-ion Battery,Operational,"&quot;Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (MHI), jointly with Scottish Hydro Electric Power Distribution (SHEPD), has begun an energy storage system demonstration project using the distribution grid in the UK&#039;s Orkney Islands, which has a high penetration of renewable energy. The project aims at demonstrating power supply stabilization in the region by introducing a container-housed large capacity energy storage system using lithium-ion rechargeable batteries, with a power output/input capability of 2MW (megawatts). The storage system will be handed over for operation in the middle of 2013.   The demonstration project is conducted with the support of New Energy and Industrial Technology Development organization (NEDO) of Japan, under the &quot;&quot;Development of Technology for Safe, Low-cost, Large-size Battery System&quot;&quot; programme. In the project, Mitsubishi Power Systems Europe, Ltd. (MPSE), the business base for MHI&#039;s power system operations in Europe, will jointly provide the energy storage service to Scottish Hydro Electric Power Distribution plc (SHEPD) The funding for the project is being provided to SHEPD from OFGEM, under it&#039;s Tier 1 Low Carbon Network Fund.  The energy storage system, which has the capacity to store approximately 800kWh (kilowatt hour) nominal, 500kWh normal usage, consists of two 40ft containers for the batteries and a 40ft container for the power conditioning system. Each battery container houses more than 2,000 units of lithium-ion rechargeable batteries and its management system. The power conditioning system container houses a system for conversion of direct current (DC)/alternating current (A/C) and the associated input/output controls.  The energy storage system will be installed at SHEPD&#039;s Kirkwall Power Station. In the cases of power shortage or power surplus on the Orkney Islands, power is transmitted from/to the mainland through two 33kV submarine cables. When there is too much renewable energy, exceeding the export capacity of the cable to the mainland, the energy storage system will import part of the excess energy, reducing the need to constrain renewable generation on the islands, by reducing or stopping generator export.&quot;   http://www.all-energy.co.uk/__novadocuments/86694?v=635673060322170000",2000,0.25,58.984674,-2.96,,"Transmission Congestion Relief, ",,Kirkwall,Orkney,,United Kingdom,http://www.pv-magazine.com/news/details/beitrag/orkney-hosts-uks-first-2-mw-energy-storage-trial_100012415/#axzz3hOSyEyI3,01-11-2012,01-06-2013,,,SHEPD,,,,,Third-Party-Owned,Mitsubishi Power Systems Europe (MPSE),0,SSE Generation (Grid connection transfomer  etc.),,"Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.

New Belgium Brewery  - City of Fort Collins Utilities,Thermal Storage,Ice Thermal Storage,Ice Thermal Storage,Operational,"This project as part of Fort Collins Utilities Four Cities Smart Grid Development Project will address the research, development, and demonstration of a coordinated and integrated system of 3.5 MW of mixed distributed resources in Fort Collins, Colorado to achieve a 20-30 percent peak load reduction on two distribution feeders. These two feeders serve the planned FortZED Jump Start Zone (Ft. Collins Zero Energy District, in which the district creates as much thermal and electrical energy locally as it uses). This project will modernize and transform the electrical distribution system of the City of Fort Collins by reducing distribution feeder peak loads, increasing the penetration of renewables, and delivering improved efficiency and reliability to the grid and resource asset owners.   Fort Collins is well positioned to successfully complete this project due to 1) the unique combination of world-class research facilities at Colorado State University, 2) participation of global industry leaders and local entrepreneurs able to commercialize the technology, 3) the City of Fort Collinsâ€™ focus on and investments in clean energy as a key pillar of future growth, and 4) the presence of a city-owned utility and extensive community support.  As a small portion of this project, thermal storage will be installed at the following sites:  Site 1: New Belgium Brewing -- deploys new 200-kW PV arrays with AE inverters; a 292-kW methane-based Gauscor CHP; a 650-kW CAT 3508C methane-based CHP; a 135-kW new thermal storage; and a 160-kW load shedding potentials.  Site 2: City of Fort Collins Facilities -- deploys a 500-kW conventional generator with Woodward controls and Eaton switchgear; a 92-kW thermal storage; a 5-kW PV array; a 62-kW HVAC and DSM; and 2x10kW Ford Escapes (PHEVs).  Site 3: Colorado State University - deploys an 80-kW thermal storage; an 80-kW fan variable speed drives; a 21.6-kW water fountain pumps; a 3.6-kW hot water heater controls; a 6-kW daylight control, and a 950-kW conventional gensets with Woodward controls and Eaton switchgear.",135,6,41,0,,"Electric Bill Management, Electric Energy Time Shift, ",500 Linden St,Fort Collins,Colorado,,United States,http://www.newbelgium.com/Sustainability/Environmental-Metrics/Energy,07-06-2010,01-09-2013,,,,Fort Collins Utilities Light &amp; Power,Public Owned,Primary Distribution,,Customer-Owned,City of Fort Collins,0,,,Ice Energy,,Spirae,,,,,,,0,https://www.smartgrid.gov/files/09-0007-fort-collins-project-description-08-12-11.pdf,0,0,Federal/National American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 â€“ RD&amp;D,"Department of Energy, Office of Electricity - ARRA Smart Grid Demonstration Program",18101263,,,0,,,0,Colorado State University,"The project will address the research, development, and demonstration of a coordinated  and integrated system of 3.5 MW of mixed distributed resources in Fort Collins,  Colorado to achieve a 20-30 percent peak load reduction on two distribution feeders.",http://vpr.colostate.edu/pages/mainpage.htm,,,,,,,,,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,

The technology demonstrations will include three main areas: (1) Energy Smart Customer Devices such as smart appliances, home scale energy storage, and photovoltaic (PV) solar systems to achieve Zero Net Energy homes and Zero Grid Impact electric vehicle (EV) charging at work; (2) Year 2020 Distribution System including distribution automation with looped circuit topology, advanced voltage/VAR control, advanced distribution equipment, smart metering, utility-scale storage, and dispatched renewable distributed generation; and (3) a Secure Energy Network to demonstrate end-to-end management of a complex high performance telecommunication system linking the CAISO to SCEâ€™s back office, field networks, and energy smart devices in the home. Other specific aspects of sub-projects include: distribution circuit constraint management, enhanced circuit efficiency and power quality, self-healing circuits, deep grid situational awareness, and end-to-end cyber security and interoperability. The demonstration will be conducted in Irvine, California and will include two 12kV distribution circuits fed by SCEâ€™s MacArthur Substation, residential homes, and EV charging in a parking lot at the University of California, Irvine.  Fourteen residential energy storage units (RESUs) have been installed as part of the Irvine Smart Grid Demonstration (ISGD). Each RESU contains a 4 kilowatt inverter and 10 kilowatt-hours of LG Chem Ltd. automotive-grade lithium-ion batteries, with a total capacity of 56 kW. The RESU provides backup to secure loads in the event of an outage, and couples up to 4 kW of photovoltaic solar panels with the battery. These systems combine a number of control mechanisms to allow valuation of various operating or control modes. The RESUs communicate with SCE SmartConnect Meters and a remote RESU Server to gather published prices, instantaneous demand, Demand Responses, and utility control information. Throughout the two-year demonstration project, the RESUs will be operated in six different operating modes to investigate their value on the customerâ€™s energy usage and SCEâ€™s distribution circuit.

Reisseck II Pumped Storage Power Plant,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"Through the construction of the pumped storage power plant Reisseck II, VERBUND is not only investing in the expansion of renewable energies but - in connection with the existing power plants Malta and Reisseck - is also creating one of Europe&#039;s most efficient hydropower plant groups in Carinthia&#039;s MÃ¶ll Valley.  The high Alpine project area for the pumped storage power plant Reisseck II is located in MÃ¼hldorfer Graben at a height of up to 2,300 metres (m) where the Great MÃ¼hldorfer Lake will later function as an upper basin. The cavern power plant Reisseck II will be erected 1,585 m above sea level in the mountain and equipped with two powerful pump turbines.  Similar to a normal storage power plant, Reisseck II will produce peak electricity in high demand periods, whereby water will be transported via a works water channel from Great MÃ¼hldorfer Lake to the two turbines that drive the generators. The processed water will run into a lower basin.  Both of the machines units in the mountain can be switched to pump operation, whereby the generators will then function as motors and the turbines will pump the water from the lower basin back up to the upper basin. Pump operation will take place during the day when the European grid is carrying more electricity than is required by the consumers. Energy which, for example, comes from the large wind farms or the Danube power plants can be saved in the form of pumped-up water. The pumped storage power plant Reisseck II will therefore function as a &quot;green battery&quot; in the Alps. The power plant will have a capacity of 430 megawatt (MW), both in turbine and pump operation. This corresponds to the electricity generating capacity of approximately 200 wind turbines.  On completion of the rock cavern for the power plant in 2011, the boring of the works water channel to Great MÃ¼hldorfer Lake commenced in the first half of 2012 with an 880-ton (t) and 220 m tunnel boring machine. The assembly work on Austria&#039;s largest power plant construction site commenced in summer 2012. 300 experts are currently working on this high Alpine site. The newest VERBUND pumped storage power plant Reisseck II will be commissioned in 2014. The total investment volume amounts to â‚¬ 385 million.  A 200-ton transformer works its way up to Reisseck power plant  In the project Reisseck II, assembly work is going full speed ahead. Of all power plant components, the block transformer with a tare weight of 200 tons is the heaviest single component.  The transformer was delivered to Spittal on the river Drau by rail. Several tractive units harnessed in front of the transformer heaved it from the MÃ¶lltal valley to the power plant cavern, located 1000 meters higher â€“ a logistic challenge!  http://www.power-technology.com/projects/reisseck-ii-pumped-storage-power-plant-carinthia/?goback=%2Egmp_3698324%2Egde_3698324_member_5812132009241239554#%21",430000,0,47.0791667,13.34,,"Electric Energy Time Shift, Electric Supply Capacity, ",,KÃ¶lnbrein Dam,Carynthia,,Austria,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta-Reisseck_Power_Plant_Group#Reisseck-Kreuzeck_power_plants,,01-01-2014,01-08-2010,,,,,,,Third-Party-Owned,VERBUND Hydro Power AG,0,"KELAG, ENERGIE AG",,,Andritz,,,VERBUND Hydro Power AG,Poyry Energy,HPC,,European Investment Bank ($202m),0,,0,0,,,0,,,0,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,

The project is based at SCEâ€™s Monolith Substation in Tehachapi, California and includes a 32 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) and the associated power conversion system. The project will evaluate the performance of the BESS to improve grid performance and assist in the integration of large-scale variable energy resourced generation. Project performance will be measured with 13 specific operational uses: 1. Provide voltage support and grid stabilization 2. Decrease transmission losses 3. Diminish congestion 4. Increase system reliability 5. Defer transmission investment 6. Optimize size of new renewable-related transmission 7. Provide system capacity and resource adequacy 8. Integrate renewable energy (smoothing) 9. Shift wind generation output 10. Frequency regulation 11. Spin / non-spin replacement reserves 12. Ramp management 13. Energy price arbitrage. Most of the operations either shift other generation resources to meet peak load and other electricity system needs with stored electricity, or resolve grid stability and capacity concerns that result from the interconnection of variable energy resources.

Amber Kinetics Flywheel Energy Storage Demonstration - Full-scale Mechanical Flywheel Battery,Electro-mechanical,Flywheel,Flywheel,De-Commissioned,"&lt;p&gt;Amber Kinetics is developing a flywheel system from sub-scale research prototype to full-scale mechanical flywheel battery and will conduct both a commercial-scale and a utility-scale demonstration. The goal is to deliver a cost-effective prototype flywheel system that can be grid connected and electrically charged and discharged. The system will have built-in sensing components that can determine frequency and voltage characteristics of the grid and can override the grid signal to manage the amount of electricity discharged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flywheel stores energy in a spinning rotor that is connected to an electric motor that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. To recover the energy the motor is electrically reversed and used as a generator to slow down the flywheel converting the mechanical energy back into electrical energy. Amber Kinetics will improve the traditional flywheel system by engineering breakthroughs in three areas, resulting in higher efficiency and radically reduced cost: magnetic bearings, low-cost rotor, and high-efficiency motor generator. This technology can also be used to optimize existing infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 48-month project contains 3 phases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phase 1: engineering of a 10 kW / 10 kWh prototype system, includes demonstration of flywheel system, rotor performance, and demonstration of low-loss bearings and motor (Completed)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phase 2: commercial-scale prototype development, includes 100 kWh flywheel energy storage systems, with focus on scale up and cost reductions&lt;/p&gt;

A project of the Birmingham Energy Institute, itâ€™s the UKâ€™s first dedicated research facility for energy storage using cryogenic liquids. The technology is also sometimes referred to as Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CES system uses renewables inputs such as solar power or wind energy and/or off-peak electricity to liquefy air; which is drawn from the plantâ€™s immediate surroundings. The cryogenic liquid is stored at an incredibly low temperatures; below -190C. 700 litres of ambient air becomes 1 litre of liquid air after this process. When electricity is needed, the liquid is pumped to a high pressure (150 bar), vapourised into a gas, and then superheated using heat and waste heat if available. From there, it goes through an expansion process in a turbine to generate electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

Bundaberg Christian College,Electro-chemical,Electro-chemical,Lead-acid Battery,Operational,"A school in Queensland Australia is beginning to reap ï¬nancial and sustainability beneï¬ ts through its new hybrid PV and storage system.  The system, engineered and installed by GEM Energy Australia, consists of 732 state of the art Q.PRO modules that feed power into the school as well as a containerised bank of batteries.   The system was carefully designed by GEM Energy to optimise generation for onsite loads and electricity tariffs plus charge the batteries during a relatively short time period.  The site featured many roof orientations which further presented challenges during the design and installation of the PV array.  The inverters required custom programming in order to integrate with other system components.  Q CELLS PV modules were chosen for their high energy yields and high reliability in the tropical conditions experienced in Queensland Australia.

TILOS (Technology Innovation for the Local Scale Optimum Integration of Battery Energy Storage),Electro-chemical,Sodium based Battery,Sodium-nickel-chloride Battery,Contracted,"TILOS aims to demonstrate the optimal integration of local scale energy storage in a fully-operated, smart microgrid on the island of Tilos, located at the SE Aegean Sea, Greece. The island of Tilos is currently supplied with oil-based generated electricity via an undersea cable from the island of Kos. Its annual electricity consumption is in the order of 3 GWh and its peak demand, during summetime, reaches approximately 1 MW. The existence of the undersea cable allows for the investigation of the interplay between an interconnector and energy storage, and of energy trade strategies between a smart microgrid (Tilos island) and a macrogrid (the electricity system of Kos).   In this context, the main objective of TILOS is the development and operation of a prototype battery storage system, based on NaNiCl2 batteries, that will be provided with a smart grid control system and that will cope with the challenge of supporting multiple tasks. These tasks range from microgrid energy management, maximization of RES penetration and grid stability, to export of guaranteed energy and provision of ancillary services to the main grid of Kos. The battery system will support both grid-forming (stand-alone microgrid) and grid-following (microgrid coupled with the main grid) operation and will also prove its interoperability with the rest of microgrid components, including centralized RES (800 kW wind turbine and 160 kW PV power), demand side management (DSM), and distributed, residential heat storage in the form of domestic hot water.",800,3,36.4230663,27.37,,"Black Start, Frequency Regulation, Grid-Connected Commercial (Reliability &amp; Quality), Ramping, Renewables Energy Time Shift, ",,Tilos Island,"Prefecture of Dodecanese, Aegean Sea",,Greece,http://www.tiloshorizon.eu/,01-02-2015,01-07-2017,01-02-2017,,,Hellenic Electricity Distribution Network Operator S.A.,Public Owned,Primary Distribution,800 kW wind turbine and 160 kW PV power,Third-Party-Owned,TILOS consortium partners,0,,,FIAMM Energy Storage Solutions SRL,Indrivetec AG,EUNICE Laboratories SA,,,,,,,15,,0,0,Federal/National Grant,European Commission - Horizon 2020 Framework,11000000,Private/Third Party,Industrial Partners of the TILOS project,4000000,,,0,"Piraeus University of Applied Sciences - Laboratory of Soft Energy Applications (Project Coordinator for a consortium of 13 partners, see also project weblink)",,,,,,,,,,,1,0,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,

Tesla boss Elon Musk has made good on his promise to build the 100-megawatt facility on deadline or provide it free after blackouts last year that critics of the stateâ€™s Labor government blamed on pro-renewable policies.  The battery had begun dispatching some power into the stateâ€™s electricity network on Thursday afternoon as temperatures rose above 30C.

Siemens AG is a technology partner.  The special feature of the large-scale virtual storage system is the networking of the storage units of household size. The ESS feature lithium-ion storage batteries. Siemens delivers the power electronics system.  Each ESS is provided with its own control unit, so that it can react on a stand-alone basis to grid frequency. The ESS, installed in private households, are connected via the UMTS network, with the control center at Caterva, which coordinates the households as a swarm. The control center acquires the latest individual data on storage-charging levels of the ESS and regulates the swarm such that the FCR, also known as frequency regulation or balancing power, on offer is actually available. At the TenneT control station, the data are forwarded online. The N-ERGIE power plant control station is responsible 24 by 7 for operator control and supervision of the large-scale virtual storage system, as it is for its own power generating facilities.   Double benefits for households  The beneficiaries of the ESS developed by Caterva â€“ each with a total output rating of 20 kW and a capacity of 21 kWh â€“ are the operators of private roof-top PV installations. Thanks to the storage systems, these users can cover 60 to 80 % of their power requirements from their own solar systems â€“ and can at the same time contribute to German energy transition (Energiewende) by providing balancing power.  As a result of the considerably larger storage-battery capacity of the ESS in comparison to conventional PV buffer-storage, participation in the FCR market means no restriction to users in the consumption of the energy that they themselves have generated.   The first 65 ESS installations are distributed throughout the entire distribution system area of N-ERGIE, which is over 8,000 kmÂ² in size.   Contribution to grid stability  With provision of positive and negative FCR, the swarm enhances grid stability. Power balancing is necessary to compensate for the imbalance in power generation and consumption in such a way that grid frequency remains constant at 50 hertz. Balancing power is provided by transmission system operators in three specifications: FCR, Frequency Restoration Reserve, and Replacement Reserve (minute balancing power).  Demands placed on FCR are the strictest, since it must be provided within 30 seconds. Before Restoration and Replacement Reserve power, FCR is supplied directly proportionally to the deviation of grid frequency by each ESS.   Swarm Energy Storage Systems satisfy strictest requirements  The ESS swarm system has impressively fulfilled all requirements. The lithium-ion storage batteries installed in the ESS units enable a reaction period of just a few seconds. The large-scale virtual power storage system therefore balances fluctuation in the power grid within seconds and provides a key contribution to system stability.",1300,1.33,49.45203,11.08,,"Frequency Regulation, On-Site Power, Renewables Energy Time Shift, ",,Nuremberg,Bavaria,,Germany,http://swarm.bayern,01-04-2014,15-07-2015,,,TenneT,N-ERGIE AG,,,,Third-Party-Owned,Caterva,0,,,"Caterva, Saft, Siemens",,,,"Caterva, N-ERGIE",,,,,20,"More than one year successfull commercial delivery of balacing power, on average 2.700 kWh of additional self-consumption per home and year",0,0,,,0,,,0,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,

Opened by the Queen in October 1965, it is one of four pumped storage power schemes in the UK, and has the distinction of being the world&#039;s first high head reversible pumped-storage hydro scheme. The station has also been used as the setting for several films, including the James Bond film The World is not Enough.  Nicknamed The Hollow Mountain, Cruachan was constructed between 1959 and 1954 and is unique in that the station is concealed within the hollowed out rock of Ben Cruachan, 3,694 feet (1,126 m), which overlooks the visitor centre. It was conceived and designed by Sir Edward MacColl, a Scottish engineer and a pioneer of hydro electricity in Scotland, with numerous projects to his credit. The only visible features are the dam, which is 1,000 feet (316 m) wide and located 1,300 feet (390 m) up the mountain, and the station offices and visitor centre, which lie on the loch side below the dam, and next to the road.  Buried in the mountain and accessed by a tunnel 23 feet (7 m) wide and 13 feet (4 m) high, the main cavern houses four motor-generator sets capable of generating a total output of 440 MW. Construction of the main cavern, similar in size to a football pitch, required the excavation of 220,000 cubic metres of rock and soil.  The station can operate for 22 hours before the supply of water in the reservoir is exhausted, and is required to maintain a 12 hour emergency supply in reserve.

La Rance Tidal Power Station,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"La Rance Tidal Power Plant is located at the estuary of the Rance, in the municipality of La Richardais in Ille-et-Vilaine. It draws its energy from the force of the tide by using a tidal barrage. Instead of damming water on one side like a conventional dam, a tidal barrage first allows water to flow into a bay or river during high tide, and releasing the water back during low tide. This is done by measuring the tidal flow and controlling the sluice gates at key times of the tidal cycle. Turbines are then placed at these sluices to capture the energy as the water flows in and out.  The station&#039;s 24 reversible bulb pump-turbines are used to pump water into the river basin at high tide (for ebb generation). This energy is more than returned during generation, because power output is strongly related to the head. If water is raised 2 ft (61 cm) by pumping on a high tide of 10 ft (3 m), this will have been raised by 12 ft (3.7 m) at low tide. The cost of a 2 ft rise is returned by the benefits of a 12 ft rise.

Lewiston Pump-Generating Plant,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"The Niagara project, located about 4 1/2 miles downstream from the Falls, consists of two main facilities: the Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant, with 13 turbines, and the Lewiston Pump-Generating Plant, with 12 pump-turbines. In between the two plants is a forebay capable of holding about 740 million gallons of water; behind the Lewiston plant, a 1,900-acre, 22 billion gallon reservoir holds additional supplies of this liquid fuel.  Water is diverted from the Niagara Riverâ€”up to 375,000 gallons a secondâ€”and conveyed through conduits under the City of Niagara Falls to Lewiston. From there, water flowing through the Robert Moses plant spins turbines that power generators, converting this mechanical energy into electrical energy.  At night, when electricity demand is low, the Lewiston units operate as pumps, transporting water from the forebay up to the plant&#039;s reservoir.  During the daytime, when electricity use peaks, the Lewiston pumps are reversed and become generators, similar to those at the Moses plant. In this way, the water can be used to produce electricity twice, increasing production and efficiency.  To balance the need for power with a desire to preserve the beauty of Niagara Falls, the United States and Canada signed a treaty in 1950 that regulates the amount of water diverted for hydroelectricity production. On average, more than 200,000 cubic feet per second (cfs), or 1.5 million gallons of water a second, flow from Lake Erie into the Niagara River. The 1950 pact requires that at least 100,000 cfs of water spill over the Falls during the daylight hours in the tourist season, April through October. This flow may be cut in half at night during this period and at all times the rest of the year.  *** Update on progress of facility upgrade:  https://www.nypa.gov/NYPAPressCenter/PressRelease/News/NYPA%20Completes%20Upgrade%20on%20First%20of%2012%20TurbineGenerator%20Units%20at%20Niagara%20Plant%E2%80%99s%20Lewiston%20PumpGenerating%20Facility.html",240000,0,43.142984,-79.02,,"Electric Energy Time Shift, Electric Supply Capacity, Electric Supply Reserve Capacity - Spinning, ",5477 Military Rd.,Lewiston,New York,,United States,http://www.nypa.gov/facilities/niagara.htm,,28-01-1961,18-03-1957,,NYISO,New York Power Authority (NYPA),Public Owned,Transmission,,Utility-Owned,New York Power Authority (NYPA),100,,,Hitachi,,,,,Ferguson Electric,,,,0,Performance metrics not available.,0,0,,,0,,,0,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,

Alcatraz Island Microgrid ,Electro-chemical,Lead-acid Battery,Advanced Lead-acid Battery,Operational,"The US National Park Service, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, US Department of Energy and Princeton Power Systems collaborated to install a commercial scale Microgrid System on Alcatraz Island as a solution to high diesel fuel costs, pollution in the bay area, and high carbon emissions. When a shipâ€™s anchor ruptured the underwater power lines in 1950, that linked the island to San Francisco, Alcatraz was forced to turn to diesel fuel and coal as its source of power. This has led to power costs of $0.76/kWh.   Microgrid Design:  This project reflects the National Park Serviceâ€™s initiative to find an alternative way of powering the island in order to reduce fuel costs and pollution. A microgrid system, comprised of PPS inverters, a solar array, advanced lead-acid batteries, a PPS Site Controller, and back-up generators, was selected as a way to independently power the island. Designing and building the system on one of Californiaâ€™s and the U.S.â€™s most well-known historic landmarks with over 1 million visitors per year, created many challenges.   Component Placement: Preserving the island in pristine condition while completing the installation was the greatest challenge. Given that a system of this size requires a large construction effort, component placement was key. To prevent the solar array from being visible from San Francisco, it was placed on the roof of the prison in a flat configuration rather than a traditional angled configuration. The inverters, battery rack, and generators were placed in the old generator room, as this space is isolated and not accessible for tourists. The room was also protected from the harsh salt water environment.  Commissioning: The fragile natural environment and wildlife, particularly the birds (Alcatraz is an old Spanish word for pelican), added to the challenge. Extra attention was given to the solar panels after being damaged by rocks and shells dropped from overhead birds. Despite the coarse condition of the generator room, engineers were able to insulate the room to prevent future problems and ensure reliable long-term operation.",400,4.75,37.8269775,-122.42,,"Electric Supply Reserve Capacity - Non-Spinning, Microgrid Capability, Onsite Renewable Generation Shifting, Renewables Capacity Firming, ",Alcatraz Island,San Francisco,California,,United States,http://www.princetonpower.com/images/casestudies/pdfs/Alcatraz_CaseStudy_September2015.pdf,01-07-2012,30-07-2012,01-08-2012,,,,,,307 kW PV Array,Customer-Owned,"Golden Gate Recreational Area, National Park Service",100,,,East Penn Manufacturing (Deka Unigy II),Princeton Power Systems,Princeton Power Systems,,,,,,,0,$0.71/kWh,3600000,0,Federal/National American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 - RD&amp;D,DOE Federal Energy Management Program,0,,,0,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,

Ice Energy project at 10661 Business Dr.,Thermal Storage,Ice Thermal Storage,Ice Thermal Storage,Operational,"Ice Energyâ€™s flagship Ice Bear system enables a powerful change in how â€“ and more importantly when â€“ energy is consumed for air conditioning. The Ice Bear system is an intelligent distributed energy storage solution that works in conjunction with commercial direct-expansion (DX) air-conditioning systems, specifically the refrigerant-based, 4-20-ton packaged rooftop systems common to most small to mid-sized commercial buildings. The system stores energy at night, when electricity generation is cleaner, more efficient and less expensive, and delivers that energy during the peak of the day to provide cooling to the building. Daytime energy demand from air conditioning â€“ typically 40-50% of a buildingâ€™s electricity use during peak daytime hours â€“ can be reduced significantly. In kilowatts, each Ice Bear delivers an average reduction of 12 kW of source equivalent peak demand for a minimum of 6 hours daily, shifting 72 kW-hours of on-peak energy to off-peak hours. Ice Bear units are typically owned by utilities and installed at distributed locations behind the customer meter on commercial and industrial sites.

Foyers Pumped Storage Power Station ,Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Open-loop Pumped Hydro Storage,Operational,"Located on the southeast shore of Loch Ness,  Foyers is a pumped-storage power station with a small amount of conventional hydro-electric capacity. The scheme was redeveloped to focus on pumped-storage in 1969, having been purchased by the Hydro Board from the British Aluminium Company (BAC). The scheme was originally built by BAC in 1896 and was the first large-scale commercial hydro-electric scheme in the UK, used to power an aluminium smelter also located here until this closed in 1967. BAC created a reservoir by joining two small lochs to form Loch Mhor, which lies 179 m above Loch Ness and 2 miles away.  During the redevelopment, a 5 MW turbine was installed in the original power station building to replace the original plant and provide pure hydro-electric generation, while the tunnels and pipes which carried the water were reused. The River Fechlin was diverted into Loch Mhor to provide additional water and, to support the pumped-storage system, new tunnels and a further power station were built.  A new power station was built to house two 150 MW Francis generation-motor sets, each weighing 914 tonnes, with 5 m wide turbine blades. 100 cubic meters of water pass through each turbine and out into the loch every second during generation. The turbines can be brought from a standstill to full power output in less than two minutes, which makes the station extremely responsive to demand. The new scheme became fully operational in 1975.

AEP Ohio gridSMART Demonstration Project,Electro-chemical,Lithium-ion Battery,Lithium-ion Battery,Operational,"AEP Ohio and its partners are building a secure, interoperable, and integrated Smart Grid infrastructure in Ohio that demonstrates the ability to maximize distribution system efficiency and reliability, and consumer use of demand response programs to reduce energy consumption, peak demand costs, and fossil fuel emissions. The demonstration area includes 150 square miles including parts of Columbus, Bexley, Gahanna, New Albany, Whitehall, Reynoldsburg, Westerville, Blacklick, Johnstown, Alexandria, Minerva Park, and Pataskala. This area includes approximately 110,000 meters and 70 distribution circuits. AEP Ohio will implement Smart Grid technology over 58 13kV circuits from 10 distribution stations and 12 34.5kV circuits from six distribution stations. Included in this project is a redistribution management system, integrated volt-VAR control, distribution automation, advanced meter infrastructure, home area networks, community energy storage, sodium sulfur battery storage, and renewable generation sources. These technologies will be combined with two-way consumer communication and information sharing, demand response, dynamic pricing, and consumer products, such as plug-in hybrid vehicles.  The plan was to integrate 80 CES (25kW/25kWh) units of storage resources into the existing grid. After initial testing, AEP Ohio began field installations and commissioned 15 CES units into operations by December 31, 2011. Following this deployment, technical issues were discovered and the CES units were not performing to AEP Ohioâ€™s stringent standards. The CES units were removed from the field and returned to S&amp;amp;C. This component of the project has been redefined to include a limited deployment of four CES units at an outdoor test environment on AEP Ohio property to continue extensive testing.

Graciosa Project - Younicos &amp; Recharge,Electro-chemical,Electro-chemical,Lithium Ion Titanate Battery,Operational,"As on many islands of similar size, the share of renewables on Graciosa is currently limited to only 15 percent annually. No matter how many wind turbines or photovoltaic power plants are added to the grid, the lionâ€™s share of the electricity supply has to be produced by diesel generators.  To break this dependence on diesel fuel, intelligent power controls and a purpose-built Energy Management System make the current grid independent of conventional generators, whose rotating mass now sets the pace. The new system combines software with a 6 MW / 3.2 MWh battery storage system, a 4.5 megawatt wind park and a 1 megawatt photovoltaic power plant.  The new, hybrid power system on Graciosa can immediately use up to 100 percent sun and wind power. The diesel generators will only be needed for back-up in weeks with very poor weather conditions.

Santa Paula 1 - Western Grid Development LLC,Electro-chemical,Electro-chemical,Lithium-ion Battery,Operational,"SCEâ€™s 5-megawatt lithium-ion system from developer Western Grid comes with only a three-year contract term, mainly because its future energy capacity has already been spoken for, via a contract award last year to help SCE meet requirements set under Californiaâ€™s broader energy storage mandate, which requires the stateâ€™s big three utilities to procure 1.3 gigawatts of energy storage by decadeâ€™s end.  That contract, like the others under SCEâ€™s 2014 Energy Storage request for offers, calls for Western Grid to have the battery up and running by 2020. But with the new proposal, the two are planning to speed up that deployment, with the proposed contract serving as a bridge agreement for the intervening three years.   The system is designed to provide four hours of discharge at the stated capacity, thus providing resource adequacy (RA) for the 5 MW of contract capacity throughout the term of the Santa Paula 1 Contract.

Zerobase Kenya Microgrid,Electro-chemical,Lead-acid Battery,Advanced Lead-acid Battery,Operational,"In August, 2013, ZeroBase revealed plans to install microgrid hybrid technology in partnership with Princeton Power Systems, with the intent of managing and updating existing generators, energy storage systems, and solar installations in and around Lokichogio, Kenya.  A hub of humanitarian efforts in eastern Africa, Lokichogio (or simply Loki, as it is often called) hosts United Nations offices, a hospital run by the International Committee of the Red Cross, and approximately fifty NGOs. Given the regionâ€™s rural location near the border of south Sudan, its incorporated NGOs, and the surrounding communities are often reliant on generators for electrical power. Aiming to provide solutions to Lokiâ€™s power concerns, ZeroBase was recently awarded a contract to supply hybridized microgrid generation and storage systems for a one-hundred-kilowatt installation in the region, utilizing Princeton Power Systemsâ€™ Microgrid technology.  Princeton Power Systems (www.princetonpower.com) is a New Jersey-based designer and manufacturer of products for energy storage, conversion, and management.

Citizens Bank - Green Mountain Power Ice Energy Project 2,Thermal Storage,Ice Thermal Storage,Ice Thermal Storage,Operational,"Ice Energyâ€™s flagship Ice Bear system enables a powerful change in how â€“ and more importantly when â€“ energy is consumed for air conditioning. The Ice Bear system is an intelligent distributed energy storage solution that works in conjunction with commercial direct-expansion (DX) air-conditioning systems, specifically the refrigerant-based, 4-20-ton packaged rooftop systems common to most small to mid-sized commercial buildings.  The system stores energy at night, when electricity generation is cleaner, more efficient and less expensive, and delivers that energy during the peak of the day to provide cooling to the building. Daytime energy demand from air conditioning â€“ typically 40-50% of a buildingâ€™s electricity use during peak daytime hours â€“ can be reduced significantly. In kilowatts, each Ice Bear delivers an average reduction of 12 kW of source equivalent peak demand for a minimum of 6 hours daily, shifting 72 kW-hours of on-peak energy to off-peak hours.  Ice Bear units are typically owned by utilities and installed at distributed locations behind the customer meter on commercial and industrial sites.

Web2Energy Smart Grid Project ,Electro-chemical,Lithium-ion Battery,Lithium-ion Battery,Operational,"Project objectives Three pillars of Smart Grids in distribution systems The project Web2Energy is directed to implement and approve all three pillars of &quot;Smart Distribution&quot;.  1. Smart Metering â€“ the consumer participates in the energy market A few hundred electricity consumers in the supply area of HSE AG will be obtained with smart meters. These advanced meters provide many innovative functions:  Remote reading of metered values in short term intervals, Reception and visualization of price signals (variable rates) Disturbance signals and management of failures Estimation of manipulations and stolen energy Permanent meter data storage and monitoring of load profiles Supervision and control of distributed power producer, storage and controllable loads Furthermore, they provide gateways to monitor the current demand with the related costs and to further functions of building automation and in-house energy management (smart home). Variable (up to hourly) rates are offered to the clients. Current rates, the rate forecasts and the current demand are monitored. The consumer gets the opportunity to control his demand regarding non time critical loads in accordance with the offered rates. The project Web2Energy is able to achieve experiences with such a practice. The advanced meter technology comes from Landis + Gyr Austria.  2. Smart  Energy Management â€“ Clustering of small power producers  A large number of small independent power producers are supervised and coordinated in such a way that at each moment a scheduled power feeds into the distribution network in accordance with the current demand or the request from the market. Consequently, the deviation of fluctuating wind or solar power from the predictions can be compensated in real-time through the aggregation with controllable generators, loads and storage in the framework of a virtual power plant (VPP). Inside the supply area of the HSE AG this coordination will be applied with benefits. Parallel with a number of volatile of wind power and photovoltaic plants a large number controllable hydro and thermo power plants with cogeneration of heat and power (CHP), storage and controllable industrial loads are in operation. They are able to contribute to the generation and load management. The central operated VPP participates on the markets for energy and control power and optimizes the operations and the overall power in-feed. In this way all participants can achieve higher efficiency and higher compensation of their expenses in comparison with the single market access. To support the VPP operations advanced storage technologies will be established. The EUS GmbH Dortmund implements the VPP procedures. The Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN) contributes its experience of market access.  3. Smart Distribution Automation â€“ higher reliability of supply Today supply interruptions happen very rarely. When they do occur, they are caused by 96% in the medium (MV)-/low (LV) voltage distribution networks. In the case of a disturbance an inspection team has to drive along the MV/LV-terminals for disturbance allocation and supply recovery by switching operations. These procedures take on average 1 hour or more. The Web2Energy project implements an automated sequence to execute the former manual processes in a selected area of the HSE AG. This approach cuts the supply interruption down to minutes. Consequently, the very high reliability of supply in Germany will be significantly improved. The necessary control technology comes from iPLS (PL).  Linking the users: All three pillars of smart distribution require the information exchange between the users of the network like consumers, producers, terminals, control centre of the network operator, traders and VPP.  Communication channels have to cover also the last meters to these participants.",5,0.8,49.8776483,8.65,,"Electric Energy Time Shift, ",,Darmstadt,Hesse,,Germany,http://www.web2energy.com,10-09-2013,,,,,HSE AG,,,,Third-Party-Owned,European Union,0,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,0,0,Federal/National,,0,,,0,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,

Alfen recently developed the SOPRA system in order to make this possible.  SOPRA stands for Sustainable Off-grid Power Station for Rural Applications and provides for autonomous energy grids at locations where this was not previously feasible. The basic solution comprises a number of transformers, a battery pack and an advanced regulating system for the batteries, which is very mobile. The solution can therefore be used anywhere in the world. The system pays for itself within only a few years, as it replaces the expenditure on conventional energy sources such as oil and candles. Thanks to these savings in fuel costs, a SOPRA system is the ideal solution for even the poorest of countries.  The use of Lithium-ion batteries makes the SOPRA concept 10 times as compact as existing systems, so that the storage technology for approximately 10,000 users fits in a single 20 foot container. The choice for this type of battery also gives the system a long working life, while the batteries can be simply recycled.  The system works using solar energy, wind energy or water energy, but also with conventional energy sources as backup. The great advantage is that the sustainably generated energy is stored in the battery pack, rather than being lost. Due to various management and communication systems being integrated in the SOPRA concept, users can pay in a number of ways, consumption can be regulated and the system can be remote controlled. Alfen supplies the SOPRA concept on a turnkey basis, including the sustainable energy generation, the energy storage, the distribution network, the management and service and maintenance.",60,0.83,51.9872391,5.95,,"On-Site Power, Renewables Capacity Firming, Microgrid Capability, Electric Energy Time Shift, ",Ruitenberglaan 26,Arnhem,Gelderland,,Netherlands,http://www.alfen.com/en/products/text/sopra/35,11-02-2014,,,,,,,,,Customer-Owned,SOPRA Consortium,0,,,Valence Technology,ALFEN,ALFEN,,,,,,,0,,0,0,,,0,,,0,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,

Burbank Buena Vista Library #1 - Ice Energy,Thermal Storage,Ice Thermal Storage,Ice Thermal Storage,Operational,"Ice Energyâ€™s flagship Ice Bear system enables a powerful change in how â€“ and more importantly when â€“ energy is consumed for air conditioning. The Ice Bear system is an intelligent distributed energy storage solution that works in conjunction with commercial direct-expansion (DX) air-conditioning systems, specifically the refrigerant-based, 4-20-ton packaged rooftop systems common to most small to mid-sized commercial buildings. The system stores energy at night, when electricity generation is cleaner, more efficient and less expensive, and delivers that energy during the peak of the day to provide cooling to the building. Daytime energy demand from air conditioning â€“ typically 40-50% of a buildingâ€™s electricity use during peak daytime hours â€“ can be reduced significantly.

A lack of available solar power can be supplemented by power from the grid.  Mistergreen will realize and manage a nationwide network of fast charging stations at the best locations in the Netherlands. Concessions for twenty highway locations throughout the Netherlands have been obtained until 2027. The fast charging stations will be realized next to gas stations along the highway in the Netherlands.  Intergrated solar panels for onsite electricity generation will charge the batteries of the charging station. Both the battery storage and grid power provide for fast charging the EV. The battery storage pack will serve as a load-balancing power source and has smart grid functionalities.  At these highway fast charging stations, drivers can fill up their car with sustainable solar energy in less than 30 minutes.",50,2,53,0,,"On-Site Power, Electric Supply Capacity, Distribution upgrade due to solar, ",,Heemskerk,Heemskerk,,Netherlands,http://www.mistergreen.nl/,17-01-2014,,,,,,,,,Third-Party-Owned,MisterGreen Electric Lease,0,,,Alfen,Alfen,,Alfen,MisterGreen Products,,,,,15,,0,0,,,0,,,0,,,0,TU-Delft,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,

SOPRA: Food-processing factory Sustainable Powerplant,Electro-chemical,Lithium-ion Battery,Lithium Iron Phosphate Battery,Operational,"Alfen recently developed the Sustainable Off-grid Power Station for Rural Applications (SOPRA) which provides for autonomous energy grids at locations where this was not previously feasible. The basic solution comprises a number of transformers, a battery pack and an advanced regulating system for the batteries, which is very mobile. The solution can therefore be used anywhere in the world. The system pays for itself within only a few years, as it replaces the expenditure on conventional energy sources such as oil and candles. Thanks to these savings in fuel costs, a SOPRA system is the ideal solution for even the poorest of countries.  The use of Lithium-ion batteries makes the SOPRA concept 10 times as compact as existing systems, so that the storage technology for approximately 10,000 users fits in a single 20 foot container. The choice for this type of battery also gives the system a long working life, while the batteries can be simply recycled.  The system works using solar energy, wind energy or water energy, but also with conventional energy sources as backup. The great advantage is that the sustainably generated energy is stored in the battery pack, rather than being lost. Due to various management and communication systems being integrated in the SOPRA concept, users can pay in a number of ways, consumption can be regulated and the system can be remote controlled.

"Yokohama Smart City Project, SCADA Virtual Battery",Electro-chemical,Lithium-ion Battery,Lithium-ion Battery,Operational,"The Yokohama Smart City Project (YSCP) is an effort to develop a model for smart cities by means of cooperation between citizens, private companies, and the municipality, and to export the successful model to Japan and the rest of the world. Large-scale operational experiments are being held with Yokohama. The hierarchical bundling of energy management systems (EMS) enables energy management at the level of individual EMS and demand-side management at the level of the overall system.  One of the most unique undertakings of the Yokohama Smart City Project (YSCP) is the storage battery SCADA. SCADA stands for Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition and is a device monitoring and control system. The storage battery SCADA uses multiple storage batteries as one massive virtual battery to control battery charging and discharging. This type of system is nearly unprecedented anywhere in the world, and creating the system has made it possible to achieve moderated demand response (DR).  Participating in the project are Toshiba Corporation, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), Incorporated, Hitachi, Ltd., Meidensha Corporation, NEC Corporation, Sharp Corporation, and Sony Energy Devices Corporation.                              Two types of batteries are controlled by the storage battery SCADA: large batteries used to adjust electric power supply and demand; and stationary batteries used in homes, commercial buildings, and so on. The batteries used for supply and demand adjustments are lithium-ion batteries manufactured by Toshiba (300 kW), Hitachi (100 kW), and NEC and Meidensha Corporation through joint development (200 kW), providing total output of 600 kW. Batteries designed for users were installed in homes and commercial buildings by Sony Energy Devices, and batteries for office buildings in Yokohama were installed by Sharp. The storage battery SCADA performs three types of functions to control these batteries: daily operation, short-cycle supply and demand adjustment, and reserve power operation. The moderated DR mentioned above is achieved by daily operation. Specifically, the storage battery SCADA sends inquiries to home and commercial building users about their spare battery capacity on the following day. The responses received indicate how much spare capacity is available and when, as well as indicating that operations of a certain type are planned for a specific time, and therefore the remaining capacity may be used freely. Based on these responses, the storage battery SCADA borrows the spare capacity of user batteries and charges the batteries from the power grid at times when power demand is relatively low. The power company estimates the shortfall in electric power compared to the amount of power needed at peak times based on daily demand forecasts and supply plans. The storage battery SCADA receives requests from the power company, gathers spare battery capacity equal to the amount of the shortfall, and stores power. In addition, when sending inquiries about spare capacity to users, the system also asks how much the users want to be paid per kilowatt hour as an incentive (payment is made for capacity actually used in 30-minute increments). The storage battery SCADA selects batteries in homes and commercial buildings up to the required storage capacity starting with the lowest incentives. In this way, the electric power company can provide the necessary power by discharging batteries when electricity supply and demand is tight. The second function, short-cycle supply and demand adjustment, is a method of using supply and demand adjustment batteries to make up for the shortfall in short-cycle adjustment capacity provided by thermal electricity generation and hydroelectric power resulting from the introduction of renewable energy, which is subject to output fluctuations. Load frequency control is performed. The third function, reserve power operation, discharges supply and demand adjustment batteries during emergencies such as when an accident occurs to the power grid in order to minimize the effects of the accident.",600,0,35,140,,"Electric Bill Management, Electric Energy Time Shift, Electric Supply Capacity, Electric Supply Reserve Capacity - Spinning, ",,Yokohama,Kanagawa,,Japan,http://jscp.nepc.or.jp/article/jscpen/20140326/389815/index.shtml,27-03-2014,,,,,Tokyo Electric Power Corporation,,,,Third-Party-Owned,Consortium of Companies,0,,,"Toshiba, Hitachi, NEC, Meidensha Corporation",,,,,,,,,0,,0,0,,,0,,,0,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,False,False,True,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,

Frequency Regulation ESS,Electro-chemical,Lithium-ion Battery,Lithium-ion Battery,Operational,"The ESS-based frequency regulation is a new technology that uses instant charge and discharge of ESS, instead of current method of controlling output of thermal power plants, to maintain the frequency (60Hz) of changing electric power systems. The new technology allows to maintain momentary power balance more efficiently.  KPX said the new technology will provide benefits of improving operation of electric power systems and creating new businesses as it allows thermal power plants to reduce cost factors in regulating frequency.  And, it will enable power generation companies to minimize high-cost LNG-fired power generation by increasing use of low-cost power generation, while avoiding construction of additional power plants needed for securing power reserves. It will also reduce emission of pollutant (yellow plume) and allow companies to reduce consumption of high-priced batteries thanks to ESS-based short cycle service.  Moreover, it will enable low cost power plant, which is in output cutback operation to regulate frequency, to conduct fixed output operation by 100% by storing power of electric power systems in ESSs when frequency rises and discharging stored power when frequency drops. It is analyzed that companies will be able to drastically reduce power generation costs in this way.  In conjunction with 10 companies, including Hyosung, SK Innovation, LG Chem, LSIS, KPX plans to carry forward the project of developing technologies and systems needed for introducing ESS-based frequency regulation service (project title: Development of ESS operating system for regulating frequency of electric power systems and electric power market system) for three years(2013~2016), investing a total of 21.5 billion won (10 billion won by the government and 11.5 billion won by private sector).",4000,0.5,34.8533747,127.73,,"Frequency Regulation, ",280 Wolnae-dong,Yeosu-si,Jeollanam-do,,"Korea, South",http://energy.korea.com/archives/56339,27-03-2014,,,,,,,,,Customer-Owned,Korea Power Exchange (KPX),0,,,SK Innovation,Hyosung Corporation,Hyosung Corporation,,,,,,,0,Performance metrics not available.,0,0,,,0,,,0,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,

Leinster Nickel Operation PowerStore Flywheel - 1 MW PowerStore system,Electro-mechanical,Flywheel,Flywheel,Operational,"&lt;p&gt;BHP Billitonâ€™s Leinster nickel mine in Western Australia is the third-largest producer of nickel concentrate in the world. Ore is extracted from 1,000 meters underground with a large, electrically driven winder, which at 8.5 megawatts (MW) of demand shift over 120 seconds is a large cyclic load, given the unitâ€™s average power consumption is just 2 MW. To upgrade the winderâ€™s power supply, BHP installed a 1 MW PowerStore system, which reduced the total demand shift to 6.5 MW while adding 1 MW of spinning reserve to the system. Its flywheel-based energy storage system provides peak lopping and overcomes transient and cyclic loads on grid connected or isolated systems. The mine was able to increase winder production without affecting power system reliability. Fully automated, PowerStore gets power to the winder when itâ€™s needed most, and provides high resolution data of winder performance and local electrical grid disturbances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PowerStore is a compact and versatile flywheel-based grid stabilizing generator. Its main purpose is to stabilize power systems against fluctuations in frequency and voltage. It includes state-of-the-art inverters and virtual generator control software. It enables the integration of intermittent and often erratic renewable generation and the higher utilization of renewable energy generators, protecting remote communities from exposure to volatile oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PowerStore safeguards conventional microgrids, and ensures the safe integration of large amounts of wind and solar energy, reducing emissions and dependency on fossil fuels. High-speed software controls the power flow into and out of the flywheel, essentially making it a high inertia electrical shock absorber that can instantly smooth out power fluctuations generated by wind turbines or solar arrays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PowerStore acts like a STATCOM (advanced grid technology that quickly stabilizes voltage and improves power quality) and in addition is capable of rapidly absorbing or injecting real power within an isolated power network. It can stabilize both voltage and frequency, hold 18 MWs (megawatt seconds) of energy and shift from full absorption to full injection in 1 millisecond to stabilize the grid.&lt;/p&gt;",1000,0,-27.9128383,120.6973818,,"Frequency Regulation, Voltage Support, ",,Leinster,Western Australia,,Australia,http://www.ferret.com.au/c/PowerCorp/New-energy-storage-system-boosts-peak-power-to-Leinster-s-underground-winder-n689054,,,01-01-2005,,,,Investor Owned,Transmission,,Customer-Owned,BHP Billiton,100,,,ABB,ABB,,,,,,,,0,,0,0,,,0,,,0,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,,

This new form of pumped hydro storage system is based on an underground &lt;br /&gt;storage reservoir, where the water is enclosed in a membrane with up to 25 meters of soil on top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overlaying soil gives the necessary pressure to run a pump/turbine and store large amount of electrical energy, corresponding to the pressure created by the level difference in the well-known pumped storage system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The demonstration plant measures 50 x 50 meters and the average pumping head is 1 meter. Thus, it contains a total of 2 500 m3 water. The plant is covered by a 3-meter soil layer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the chosen dimensions, the membrane can store 34 kWh. It may not sound like much, but if the energy membrane is scaled by a factor 10 in all three dimensions, the stored amount of energy will reach 200 MWh which equals 8 hours of energy consumption by 50 000 single-family houses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the demonstration plant is to test the geotechnical conditions and to prepare a mathematical model for the pumped storage.

Quick Charging EV&#039;s Powered by the Sun (Breukelen),Electro-chemical,Lithium-ion Battery,Lithium Iron Phosphate Battery,Operational,"The market for electric vehicles (EV) is preparing for rapid growth in the coming years. All major car manufacturers have announced to launch an electric vehicle. The Dutch market is expected to expand to 15,000-20,000 EVs in 2013, and 1,000,000 EVs in 2025. The ambition of the Dutch government is to have 200,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2020, and a continued growth to a mature market of 1 million vehicles by 2025. For scaling up the number of electric vehicles, a charging infrastructure with 500 fast charging points is essential.   However, anxiety regarding range and finding charging stations can be a major concern for EV drivers; this range anxiety can be alleviated with the availability of fast charging stations at central locations, where a car gets fully charged within 30 minutes. The availability of fast charging stations plays a major role in the acceptance by a broad group of consumers.  An important technical challenge related to electric vehicles is the effect of charging on the classic energy grid. Moreover, the classic energy grid is not suited for fast charging of EVs, as this is accompanied by very high peaks in energy demand. Innovative solutions should be developed to overcome this problem.  MisterGreen aims at developing an important next step for electric transportation: sustainable fast charging stations next to Dutch highway gas stations, where electric cars get fully charged in 30 minutes using solar energy. MisterGreen aims at developing a smart-grid solution â€“ the energy needed for fast-charging is available via energy storage buffer batteries. There will be no peak energy demands on the classic energy grid as these batteries serve as energy buffer. The storage buffer batteries are charged using solar panels. A lack of available solar power can be supplemented by power from the grid.   Mistergreen will realize and manage a nationwide network of fast charging stations at the best locations in the Netherlands. Concessions for twenty highway locations throughout the Netherlands have been obtained until 2027. The fast charging stations will be realized next to gas stations along the highway in the Netherlands.  Intergrated solar panels for onsite electricity generation will charge the batteries of the charging station. Both the battery storage and grid power provide for fast charging the EV. The battery storage pack will serve as a load-balancing power source and has smart grid functionalities.  At these highway fast charging stations, drivers can fill up their car with sustainable solar energy in less than 30 minutes.  Haarrijn, the largest petrol station in Europe located centrally in the Netherlands will be the first demonstration/pilot location of the EV fast charging station.",50,2,52,0,,"Grid-Connected Commercial (Reliability &amp; Quality), Electric Supply Capacity, On-Site Power, Distribution upgrade due to solar, ",Rijksweg A2 bij Breukelen,Breukelen,Utrecht,,Netherlands,http://www.mistergreen.nl,,,10-10-2013,,,,Investor Owned,Transmission,,Third-Party-Owned,MisterGreen Electric Lease,0,,,Alfen,Alfen,,Alfen,MisterGreen Products,,,,,15,,0,0,Private/Third Party Equity,,0,,,0,,,0,TU-Delft,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,
