Non-OECD,
All countries that are not members of the OECD.,
Methodology,
"        This year we have made the following two methodological changes: first, energy units have been changed from million tonnes of oil equivalent to exajoules.",
"        Second, the method for estimating primary energy consumption of non-fossil sources of electricity, has been revised. ",
"        This is still based on an ‘input-equivalence’ method, i.e. on the amount of fuel that would be required by a standard thermal power station to generate the reported electricity output. ",
However the thermal efficiency assumed for that standard power plant is no longer fixed. ,
The efficiency assumption rises each year to better reflect real world improvements in the average power station thermal efficiency.,
For more details see Methodology,
As well as the change to reported energy units (from million tonnes of oil,
equivalent to exajoules) there have been the following changes in the tables:,
biofuels consumption has been broken out of oil consumption and is now,
included in renewables consumption (as well as reported separately in its,
own table). Oil consumption as defined in previous Statistical Reviews (i.e.,
including biofuels) has been renamed ‘liquids’ consumption and a table is still,
"       included on this original basis. In addition, more granularity has been included",
on the product split of both oil products and biofuels (breaking out ethane,
& LPG and naphtha in oil products and the ethanol/biodiesel split of biofuels).,
